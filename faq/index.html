              <h2>So what is Sonofit and how does it work?</h2>
              <p>
                According to scientists from the Himalayan Institute of Medical
                Sciences, hearing loss happens when the eardrum loses elasticity
                due to inflammation triggered by the body’s immune system when
                it is exposed to a new threat.
                <br /><br />
                This new threat is coming from toxic medical chemicals (or
                ototoxins) that can unfortunately be found in most of the meds
                unknowingly prescribed by doctors on a daily basis.
                <br /><br />

                By addressing the root cause of hearing loss, SonoFit acts like
                an “eardrum bandage”, soothing and helping the eardrum recover,
                while protecting it from future damage.

              <h2>Is Sonofit Safe?</h2>
              <p>

                months before we can resupply, as we are willing to accept the
                purest ingredients.
